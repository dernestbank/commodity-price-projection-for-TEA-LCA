% Column A contains the date corresponding to the start of the historic dataset to the end of the desired projection horizon (e.g., 01/01/2009 to 01/12/2046).
% Column B contains the standardised price data for the commodity being projected (e.g., 01/01/2009-01/12/2020). The remaining cells, where the data is to be projected are empty. 
% Column C contains the standardised historic and EIAâ€™s projected crude oil prices for the desired projection horizon.
% Cell F3 contains the mean of the historic data for the commodity price data. 
% Cell F3 contains the standard deviation of the original historic data for the commodity price data.
